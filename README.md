# XSPerf-Playground

This is a playground for analyzing performance data collected from XiangShan processor simulations. It uses ELF files and statistical data to provide insights into the performance characteristics of the code running on the processor.

## Get Started

Using VSCode to open `src/playground.ipynb` and modify the paths to ELF file and stat file to your own files. Then you can run the notebook cells to see the analysis results.

## TODO

- Source Code Mapping from basic blocks to source lines and columns
- Group Basic Blocks by program structure
